# Synchronous Task vs Asynchronoud Task
- Sync tasks which runs line by line and gives output instantly
- Async tasks takes some time to return output (it returns us promises) 


- NOTE : `await is only allowed in async function`

# Promisification
- It is a long word for simple transformation.
- It is the conversion of a function that accepts a callback into a function that returns a promise
- Such transformations are often required in real life, as many functions and libraries are callback based.
